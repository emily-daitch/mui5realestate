    someone that is part of a team as well, Paula was able to show us

    As first time homebuyers we asked a lot of questions,

    She made the process so smooth and stress-free,
    I don't know what we would have done without her!

    company, Staged Right ATL. This is the second home we have sold with
    Ashley. My wife and I were tasked with selling a 30-year-old
    townhouse that had belong to a friend for many years. The place was
    very dated, needed paining, and all the fixtures needed to be updated per
    Ashley's recommendations. Once those tasks were completed there was
    still just a little something missing. In walked Ashley and her staging
    company. We were gone for four or five days while this occurred. Upon
    returning and seeing the place we did not even believe it was the same
    place. We placed the house on the market and had several offers and a
    contract within four days. Bravo to Ashley, her team, and staging
    company!\"`,
