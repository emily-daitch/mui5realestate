                Ashley Bowman is a Georgia native. Her father and
                grandfather were on the building and construction side of real
                estate and her mother owned her own interior designing
                company. As a child, Ashley spent her summers and school
                holidays on job sites with her parents often coming home
                with Georgiaâ€™s own red clay on her shoes.
                She graduated from the University of West Georgia with a
                degree in Early Childhood Education. Soon after graduation
                she decided that being creative was one of the best parts of
                being a teacher. From there, she decided to combine her
                known experience and knowledge of the home building
                process, her creative passion, and her outward honesty
                together with the real estate market. Since moving to Atlanta
                15 years ago, Ashley has lived in Old 4th Ward, Virginia
                Highlands, East Atlanta, Inman Park, and Candler Park. She
                purchased her first home in Decatur and now currently
                resides in Tucker with her husband Craig and their two pugs,
                Carlton and Richard.

                Paula Girvan is from the hills of Tennessee but planted her roots in
                Georgia when she was 18 years old. She decided to call Atlanta
                home and make a name for herself by owning famous
                neighborhood pubs, popular Virginia Highland boutiques, and
                running her own real estate career in the Metro Atlanta area.
                With almost 25 years of real estate under her belt, she has helped
                many friends, family, and everyone in between meet their real
                estate goals. She has continued her passion in real estate with
                investments, remodels, and developments. WIth that being said,
                her favorite part is working with people and helping them find
                their homes and making forever friends. She currently lives in her
                mid-century modern dream house in Decatur with her 2 dogs and
                husband Mike.

            Paula and Ashley met at a Keller Williams convention in New Orleans. After getting to know
            each other and realizing they know a lot of the same people and how well they work together,
            they decided to combine forces and become a team.<br/> Together they really enjoy helping people
            achieve their real estate dreams, making people happy, and enjoying life to the fullest!<br/><br/>
            Thank you and we hope to work with you soon!<br/><br/>
